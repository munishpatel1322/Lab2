# Book Management System

## Overview
The Book Management System is a simple web application built using PHP that allows users to add and manage book details, including the title, author, and publication year. This project demonstrates the use of PHP syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and error handling.

## Features
- Input form for adding books with title, author, and year.
- Validation of input fields to ensure all required data is provided.
- Object-Oriented Programming structure with a Book class.
- Error handling to manage invalid inputs and display appropriate messages.
- Display of added books in a formatted table.

## Files
- `index.php`: The main script that contains the HTML form, processes input, and displays the list of books.
- `Book.php`: Contains the Book class definition, including attributes and methods for managing book data.
- `screenshots/`: A folder containing screenshots demonstrating form submission, book list display, and error handling.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Getting Started
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Setup a Local Server**: Ensure you have a PHP server installed, such as XAMPP or WAMP.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Place Files in Server Root**: Move the files to the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
4. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/index.php`.

## Usage
1. Fill out the form with the book's title, author, and publication year.
2. Click the "Add Book" button to submit the form.
3. The book will be added to the list below the form. If any errors occur during submission, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
